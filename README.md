This is a bank simulator, you can perform several fun tasks with it: 

1-You have to register (it's mandatory in order to access the program, else you won't be able to access the content)
The website will use your inputs to register you as a new client (make sure you input a high gross salary)
2- You can transfer money to two hard-coded real clients, and you will get a receipt for each transaction.
3- Ask for loans
4-Buy and sell stocks using Alphavantage API (stock prices are updated at the end of the week, as it's meant for long-term investing)
5-You can get the total sum of the stocks invested in the main page, and right next to it, the liquidity left.

This program mostly uses sessionStorage to save all the data, as it's sole purpose is to be a demonstration of JS.
It cointains a lot of error-handling code, to make sure every input and output is correct.
